A python implementation of modified Round Robin algorithm which takes Priority scheduling into consideration along with Time-Quantum.

I developed this script as a part of my CS 630 coursework while pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at NJIT. The script solves a particular question given by the professor as a part of the coursework. You can change the inputs as per your requirements.

The question is uploaded in a file named question.txt in the repository.
